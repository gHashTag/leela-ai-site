It is in the heart that our emotional self lives. Yogic physiology associates it with the thymus, an endocrine gland located in the region of the heart. This gland is responsible for the flow of electrical energy in the body, and the nature of sensory perception is based on electrical phenomena. Each change in emotional tone is recorded by the heart, its rhythm determines the chemical composition of the blood. Each change in the chemical composition of the internal environment, in turn, is recognized by the mind as a certain feeling or emotional state. Thus, the heart is something more than a machine that pumps pure blood towards the organs of the body, and returns the spent blood to the lungs. It is also the center of emotions, the psychic center. In the Sufi tradition, special emphasis is placed on the need to open the heart center through love (mohabbat). Hence comes poetry, the transformation of the personal into the universal. All poetry is filled with the heart, its vibrations and all sorts of experiences. This center is also the source of all transpersonal psychic phenomena."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Regardless of which way the player reached this place, they now enjoy peace.
