Performing one's duties in the proper manner, giving up one's self for what needs to be done, leads to loss of identity, which is the main problem of the third chakra. Individuality ceases to exist as a separate unit, becoming part of a larger whole. Examples of such ministry can be found in various organizations that are manifestations of the heavenly plan. Selfless Service is the last square on the third row of the game board, representing the third chakra.
