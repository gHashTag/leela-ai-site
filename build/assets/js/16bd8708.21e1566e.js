Within these states, everyone acts in accordance with their karma, and the game ends only when the player fully penetrates into its meaning, having reached the Cosmic Consciousness.

Synchronicity satisfies the need of the individual self for conscious control from the outside. This can be most easily understood by viewing this principle in the context of interpersonal relationships.
