Violence leads the player to purgatory, to the most painful conditions. Every action bears a corresponding fruit. This is the law of karma, the effect of which is inevitable as long as the player continues physical existence. Bad karma leads the player to the naraka-loka, to the place that corresponds to this karma. This is not a punishment, but a cleansing. Dharmaraja, the lord of the naraka, has no personal interest in the suffering of the players who go there. Rather, his work is to correct negativity, making way for future spiritual development. Naraka is also the heart chakra itself. Attachment to feelings is naraka, feeling of attachment is naraka. Naraka is negative vibrations. A person who radiates negativity creates naraka in his own house, family, district, city, country or world, depending on his capabilities. Getting into the naraka-loka without the understanding inherent in the fourth level, the player looks at the situation as a failure, he does not see the consequences of negative karma in it. Then it becomes obvious that naraka-loka is nothing but a sign of imperfection of actions, which must be corrected. In the fourth chakra there is awareness without evaluation."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
