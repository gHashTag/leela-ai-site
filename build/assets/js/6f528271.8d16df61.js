Seventy-two squares of the playing board with all the arrows and snakes that bind them, which represent the seventy-two main planes of being, reveal to us the knowledge contained in the Vedas, Shruti, Smriti and Puranas. To play this game is to come into contact with the divine wisdom contained in the teachings of Yoga, Vedanta and Samkhya, which are the flesh and blood of the Hindu tradition. During the game, you automatically move around the fields of the playing board, each of which has a specific name, reflecting one of the internal states, or planes of being. Once on a particular field, the player begins to think about ideas and concepts associated with the name of this field, until it is again his turn to roll the die to move on to the next state.

The number rolled on the die is determined not by the player\'s identifications, but by the interaction of cosmic forces, which, in turn, determine the development of the human game of life.
