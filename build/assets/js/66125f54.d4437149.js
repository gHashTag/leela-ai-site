Like a true devotee, prana faithfully serves our consciousness 24 hours a day. But prana has its own temperament. Even a small change in the attitude of the host affects the speed and rhythm of the cycle. A good master who understands the devotion of his servant should try to help the prana develop. The methods necessary for this are called pranayama and constitute one of the most important sections of the yogic discipline."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In yoga, prana is a concept of paramount importance. By practicing pranayama, the yogi directs the flow of prana down to the pelvic plexus, where it mixes with apana, the energy located in the lower body. When prana and apana flow together through the sushumna, the central channel of the spine, to the top of the head, the yogi experiences samadhi, which is the goal of all yoga practices. Prana should not be confused with oxygen. Oxygen supplies energy to the gross physical body. Prana, on the other hand, maintains the existence of the physical body: prana is life itself. To understand prana, life and consciousness must be considered separately from each other. Life is the mechanism through which consciousness manifests, and prana is its driving force. When life ceases, consciousness remains. This is indicated by numerous documented cases of reincarnation."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
