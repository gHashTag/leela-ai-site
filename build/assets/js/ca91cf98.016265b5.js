The emotional experience of sense perception is registered in the chitta. The aspect that thinks that it is he who perceives and enjoys the sense experience as a separate person is the ego or ahamkara.

However, it is only in the seventh chakra that he really achieves identity with himself and begins to stabilize around the inner center.

In Indian mythology (Puranas) there are many examples of such selfishness, which has always been achieved after severe asceticism and austerities. After the applicant sought the reward of power or power, but became a victim of selfishness, he proclaimed himself God. Because of this false identification, he always fell down to the first chakra with its inherent anger, greed, delusion, vanity and greed. The whole planet was in disarray. In one of these cases, the Earth, taking the form of a cow, appeared before Vishnu and asked him to free her from the burden of selfishness. At that moment, as described in the epic, Vishnu, the great protector of life, took form and was born on Earth. In Leela, God comes out to kill the dragon of selfishness in the player, for selfishness is contrary to the conservation principle.
