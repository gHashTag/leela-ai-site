Their confluence is called Prayag, and this name is often used to mean the "third eye". Sushumna remains invisible, while Ida and Pingala are represented by two eyes. In Indian mythology, one of the most important holy places is Prayag Raj, where the three most sacred rivers, the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati, join. Ganga and Yamuna are ida and pingala. Both of them are visible, as the two eyes of a person are visible. The Saraswati River is invisible, it flows to Prayag from the depths of the earth. The same symbolism can be seen in the Greco-Roman image of the staff of the divine healer Aesculapius. Two snakes coil around the central winged staff. These snakes are ida and pingala, and the wand is sushumna.'))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
