In accordance with the cosmological system adopted in Hinduism, there are seven classes of beings in the universe: devas, yakshas (or kinnaras), gandharvas, manushyas, asuras (or rakshas), bhutas and pishachas. Pishachas represent the lowest kind of consciousness based on violence and betrayal. The next are the bhutas, or disembodied spirits, unable to leave the earthly plane of existence due to attachment, living in the past. Then follow the asuras - creatures that do not recognize ethical standards of behavior, living in search of sensual pleasures ("wine, women and songs"). The next class is manushyas (people). They believe in the laws of karma and responsibility for the consequences of their actions. Manushyas can foresee the future and understand the nature of liberation. This is the plan of human existence. Gandharvas are creatures dedicated to the service of the gods and living in harmony with divine music. They inspire people through sound and music. Then come the yakshas - their consciousness is based on the knowledge and understanding of cosmic principles and the direct experience of divine grace. And finally, there are the devas, pure forms of the energy of the deities themselves.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"When the player reaches yaksha-loka, his attention is drawn to the question of the nature of divine existence.
