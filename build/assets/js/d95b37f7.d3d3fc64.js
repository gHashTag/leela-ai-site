And just as a mother gives her milk to a child, so the earth gives food, vitality and energy to all living things."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Earth is the player's symbol for the sixth chakra. She is the result of a great asceticism. Her awe-inspiring birth in the fire allowed her to give birth to a great variety of forms and energy flows that filled her entire surface. She is patience and forbearance. Despite the fact that her children cut her body and burn her soul, she gives them diamonds, gold, platinum. She unselfishly follows the law of Dharma and makes no distinction between high and low. That is why the earth field is located in the sixth chakra. We see her body, the physical plane of the first chakra. What we cannot see is her spirit, her understanding, her generosity and kindness, her greatness. This is the understanding that comes to the player when he reaches the sixth chakra.

Sometimes during the course of the game, players rise several levels, experiencing states of compassion, wisdom, or true knowledge. These arrows lift them to higher planes. But if in reality (according to the level of vibrations) they do not belong to these plans, there are no guarantees that they will reach the Cosmic Consciousness. One way or another, they must move on, and the game gives them a snake leading from the tamoguna square (field 72) to the earth plane, where they can make a new effort. Each time a player ascends to the higher planes but fails to achieve Cosmic Consciousness, they must return home to their Mother Earth."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"And the better the player gets to know the earth, the deeper he can appreciate the elusive balance that maintains life on its surface.
