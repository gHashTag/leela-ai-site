Enlightened souls with light bodies live here, who have not yet reached Satya Loka - the plane of reality. The vayu-loka player has already made his transition through Omkara and has reached, due to his karma, higher modes of vibration. In Indian mythology, there are also Maruts - friends and brothers of Indra, who control the atmosphere of the physical plane. They bring rain and fill the earth with vitality. They become pranic energy on the physical plane and the breath of life of breathing souls. Air is synonymous with movement inside and outside the body. All movements of fluids within living organisms are due to air. Air is the essence of life. Thus, air exists everywhere.
