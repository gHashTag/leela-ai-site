He is so carried away by the illusion of himself as a separate reality that any means of satisfying his desires seem just to him. After all, the vain gambler thinks, I am so much better than the others that I deserve to have everything they have. So, in this game, greed is associated with the snake of envy, because. it is envy created by vanity that leads to greed. In the state of greed, the player experiences active hatred towards other players. He is too good for them, and what they have is also too good for them. Therefore, the player argues, what belongs to them should be mine. He becomes unfriendly and has a passionate desire to take possession of the material wealth of the people around him. This feeling is different from greed, where only the material side is visible. Greed is greed combined with envy. As the player becomes more and more greedy, their thirst for wealth increases.
