There, on the surface, there is a clear clear sky and light, but inside there is only confusion and insoluble problems created by fantasy. Just as a child who is afraid of the dark hides under a blanket, so the player thinks that as soon as he opens himself up, the horrors waiting outside will immediately engulf him.
