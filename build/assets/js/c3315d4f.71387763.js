A player who is able to create more psychic energy thereby develops a personal magnetism that draws to him those who fall under the influence of this power. Magnetism is actually a manifestation of balance. Magnetic force is created by the interaction of the north and south poles of any substance that can store this energy. When the flow of energy from one pole to the other is unobstructed, a magnetic field is created. In the same way, if a person meditates at a time when the breath through the left nostril dominates, there is a continuous flow of psychic energy."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Through meditation, the player enters the lunar plane.

At this level, all energy is one, and the feminine energy loses its destructive nature. Here it appears in its creative constructive manifestation. The left (lunar) nostril promotes not only meditation, but also the enjoyment of music, dance, poetry. Lunar breathing soothes pain, dispels sorrows, it helps to restore the forces of consciousness.
