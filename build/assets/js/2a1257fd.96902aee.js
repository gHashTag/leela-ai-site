All this is due to a lack of energy necessary for a harmonious stay on this plane. Diffusion of life force towards sense objects is a major problem at the level of the second chakra. The player can land on a void space after the first encounter with entertainment, the sensual plane, self-importance, or greed. If he comes here from the first chakra, he may have already experienced the joys of purification or entertainment, but the small amount of energy he possessed is wasted too quickly.
