A bhakta devotee loves his Deity. The deity is the lover, and the devotee is the lover. The bhakta suffers from separation and yearns to meet, or at least catch a glimpse of, her lover. Nothing else attracts him, nothing holds his attention, everything else loses its meaning. Food, sleep, sex, attachments, affairs - nothing else matters. He is completely absorbed in his feeling of separation and in ecstasy prays only to receive at least one look from the Lord. When a bhakta is blessed by divine grace, he experiences inseparable oneness and a non-dual state of consciousness is established. He and his God are now one, and the experience of God itself is evidence of grace and blessing from the Divine.'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Bhakti is the direct method, the shortest way to the Divine. All yoga and all knowledge, jnana, rests on the cornerstone of true faith, true devotion and love, true bhakti. There is nothing higher than love, and bhakti is the religion of love. Love is truly God. Lighting the candle of love with the spark of knowledge and practicing the yoga of love is bhakti. At the final stage of opening the sixth chakra, when the player has already acquired the qualities of fluidity he needs and cleared his mind, he understands the true value of the game. He understands reality both as it really is and as it seems. He realizes the need for austerity and true knowledge, jnana and sudharma, and selfless service. He also sees that anger, vanity, worthlessness, suffering and ignorance are all significant aspects of life experience. It is beyond any ratings. Everything has equal value and value. He knows that while he is in the body, the die of his karma will carry him forward in his journey, level by level, square by square.

Having mastered his will, he achieved inner stability. Now, for further development, he must find the emotional center of his life. To purify himself of self-identification, he has no choice but to identify himself with the Divine in some particular form or in all forms. But this does not matter, because for a player who has fallen into the field of bhakti-loka, each form becomes all forms at the same time. In whatever form he meets the Lord, all others will also be received by him. The form becomes the Divine, and the Divine becomes the bhakta himself, experiencing inexpressible bliss. Previously, the player could not accept the game as the basis of his own nature, remaining bound by the vibrations of the sixth chakra. His energy increased too quickly, which could lead him to violence. However, Leela's complete acceptance gives him devotion to the game itself."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"He sees in the states represented by the cells of the playing board the play of divine energy and experiences unity with them.
