However, no one wants to stay down. When the vibrations of the player become inharmonious, he falls under the influence of the snakes and falls to the lower planes. All his movements up and down are determined by the number he rolls on the dice. When a person falls under the influence of envy, his energy goes down. By coincidence of karmic circumstances, he fell into the second chakra plane, but he really does not deserve to stay here. In fact, he cannot remain on this plane because of the negative vibrations left in his personality. At such moments, the player envies those who are able to stay on higher planes without losing balance. Envy is the negative reaction that causes the player to fall to the level of the first chakra, where he will have to realize and work out new elements of his negative karma."))}f.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
