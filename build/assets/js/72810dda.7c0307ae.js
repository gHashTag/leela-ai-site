Those who develop as a result of hard work on themselves are sent to these worlds depending on the state of their consciousness.

His ability to penetrate the nature of the space-time continuum allows him to see the beginning and end of creation. By continuing to live in his limited body, he becomes unlimited. The player knows that he is an immortal spirit in a mortal body. Death ceases to inspire horror. And here the player begins to understand what \u201cYou are That\u201d and \u201cI am It\u201d means - in Sanskrit it sounds like Tat tvam asi and hamsa.

His whole understanding of himself must change radically. He must acknowledge the presence of the Divine within himself. He must feel his infinite nature. The sound Om becomes his mantra here. It is a cosmic sound that creates a resonance in his system and helps to raise his energy level. At every moment he hears his inner sound. Filled with power, this sound gradually spreads everywhere until it becomes all-consuming, enclosing all the sounds surrounding it, internal and external. Everyone who is close to him becomes calm and begins to hear the same sound generated by his own system.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,'Each player has a special effect on other players depending on the level at which he is currently located. The presence of a person of the first chakra makes a frightening or pathetic impression. He either aggressively strives for physical survival, or complains bitterly about his inability to achieve it. A person of the second chakra, preoccupied with the satisfaction of his sensual desires, seeks to charm people, his voice is seductive and sweet. A player whose vibrations have reached the third chakra is constantly looking for a challenge to himself. He affirms his "I" wherever possible, and whenever possible, in search of even more confirmation of the virtues he has already acquired. The player of the fourth chakra inspires the players around him. He has found his emotional center and does not produce threatening vibrations. The player, who is at the level of the fifth chakra, holds a mirror created from his own experience in which other players can see their reflection. The human presence of the sixth chakra opens the Divine. Next to him, other players lose their self-identification, internal barriers dissolve, and they strive to connect their consciousness with the consciousness of the one who has established himself in the plan of asceticism.'))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
