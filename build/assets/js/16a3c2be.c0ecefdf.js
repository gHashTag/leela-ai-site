Violent actions can be performed by players in the lower chakras, but they are considered by players as self-defense, as a reaction to an external threat.

Violence of the second chakra is associated with sex and pleasure. The lust for power breeds \'violence in the third chakra. A man of the fourth chakra kills to get rid of karma, to settle old scores. Agnosticism is the engine of violence in the fifth chakra. In the sixth chakra, the establishment of a creed, cult or religion inevitably creates motivation for the concentration of excess power. Those who are responsible for such pseudo-holy wars between people were extreme ascetics who went through severe asceticism in order to gain strength. But, if the karma is unfavorable, asceticism itself can lead a person to a dangerous kind of solipsism. The player believes that he possesses all truth\u2014that he himself is, in fact, God, or at least his messenger.
