# LEELA AI ($LEELA)

---

**Leela Ai ($LEELA)** is a utility **token** that is used in the **Leela Ai** gaming application.
The application automatically deducts **1 $LEELA** from the user's balance with each move made in the game.
**$LEELA** can be purchased on the exchange or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.
This **$LEELA** usage model encourages players to **purchase** and use the **token** within the gaming ecosystem to participate in the game. This could also create additional value for the token itself, as its demand will depend on player activity on the **Leela Ai** app.
